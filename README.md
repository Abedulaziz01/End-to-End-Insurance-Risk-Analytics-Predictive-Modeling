🔍 From Raw Data to Actionable Insights: An Insurance Analytics Journey
By Abdulaziz
📌 Introduction
After meticulously cleaning and analyzing a comprehensive insurance dataset, we uncovered fascinating regional trends, pricing patterns, and vehicle preferences across South Africa. This report highlights key discoveries and strategic recommendations—all made possible through rigorous data cleaning and exploratory analysis (EDA).

🔎 Key Insights from EDA
📍 1. Regional Insurance Preferences
Our data revealed striking geographic differences in policy choices:

🏙️ Gauteng leads with 41,268 "Own Damage" policies—reflecting its urban, high-value vehicle market.

🌊 Coastal Provinces (KZN, Western Cape, Mpumalanga) prefer Third-Party coverage, likely due to different risk factors.

🛣️ Eastern Regions (Eastern Cape, Limpopo, Free State) favor "Cleaning & Debris Removal" add-ons, possibly linked to road conditions.

💡 Business Takeaway: Tailor insurance bundles to regional needs—e.g., debris removal packages in Eastern Cape, comprehensive plans in Gauteng.

💰 2. Premium Pricing Trends
Average premiums vary significantly by province:

Province Avg. Premium (R)
KwaZulu-Natal 77.80 💸 (Highest)
Eastern Cape 70.55
Northern Cape 49.62 💰 (Lowest)
🔍 Why?

KZN’s high premiums may stem from accident rates, fraud risks, or demand.

Northern Cape’s lower costs could indicate untapped market potential.

🚀 Recommendation: Investigate KZN’s pricing drivers and assess if Northern Cape is underpriced.

🚗 3. Vehicle Make Popularity
Toyota dominates, but secondary brands vary:

🏆 #1 Everywhere: Toyota (e.g., 306K policies in Gauteng alone!).

🥈 #2 in 6/9 Provinces: Mercedes-Benz (luxury preference).

🛠️ Budget Choice: CMC ranks in top 3 in 5 provinces.

🚘 Unexpected Finds:

Golden Journey (#3 in Gauteng—12K policies).

Iveco (#3 in Western Cape—3.8K policies).

💼 Strategic Opportunity: Partner with Toyota for bundled insurance deals and explore niche markets (e.g., Iveco in Western Cape).

🧹 How Data Cleaning Enabled Reliable Insights
Before analysis, we:
✔ Removed useless columns (e.g., 100% empty fields).
✔ Fixed missing values (smart imputation for fairness).
✔ Cleaned duplicates (14 exact copies removed).
✔ Capped outliers (for accurate premium averages).

📊 Without this prep, insights would be misleading!

🎯 Strategic Recommendations
📌 Regional Product Tweaks

Launch debris removal packages in Eastern Cape/Limpopo.

Offer luxury vehicle bundles in Gauteng (Mercedes-Benz focus).

💵 Pricing Adjustments

Investigate why KZN premiums are high—is it risk or opportunity?

Test discounted Northern Cape promotions to boost uptake.

🤝 Manufacturer Partnerships

Toyota co-branded policies (huge market share).

Specialized Iveco/Golden Journey plans (niche segments).

🔮 Final Thoughts
This project proves that clean data = trustworthy insights. By combining technical rigor with business context, we transformed messy records into actionable strategies.
